# CSC120-FinalProject

## Deliverables:
 - Your final codebase
 - Your revised annotated architecture diagram
 - Design justification (including a brief discussion of at least one alternative you considered)
 - A map of your game's layout (if applicable)
 - `cheatsheet.md`
 - Completed `rubric.md`
  
## Additional Reflection Questions
 - What was your **overall approach** to tackling this project?
Since it was a group project, we first have a discussion about the general theme and content of the project and listed the basic classes and functions out. The first week was generally about building up the skeleton of the project, when we have a cleared understanding of each of the classes we were implementing and what they are suppose to do (it was also filled up with mostly trials and errors). The second week concentrates more on writing out the main body of the project, including basic funcionality of each class and started to build up small blocks inside the Game (where this game happens) and Oldman (where most instructions happens). The third week moves onto finishing up the main body and refining the details and storyline. We didn't generally find certain times to work on the project, instead, we try to find some time every day to work on the project and progress was made significantly when looking back on a weekly scale.

 - What **new thing(s)** did you learn / figure out in completing this project?
 Zhiwen Ji: I think I've learned how to really use all the knowledge learned in this semester (from each individual assignments) and the concept of object oriented programming itself when completing this project. Also, it feels really good to "develop" this (easy) game by myself!
 Yuyao Zhu: I learned a lot of pratical skills, and it also helps develop skills to collaborate with others.

 - Is there anything that you wish you had **implemented differently**?
 Zhiwen Ji: I wish I would implement going to different floors in the mainhouse differently. Now it has two separate parts, the first one needs input to be "GO UP" or "GO DOWN" to move between floors and the second one needs input to be certain floor numbers. I originally had the codes like this because I also want to call goUpFloor() and goDownFloor() methods, but I feel like it makes my code to be an if-else structure and I think there would be another way to make it more efficiently written. Moreover, I think there are some attributes that are not used so often in the program, if I had unlimited time, I would think more carefully about defining those attribute. (I didn't do so now because I'm afraid it would trigger a disaster..) There're also things to be improved about printing of the project (about the spacing of new lines), and whether to make the attributes private or public and be consistent with those. The scanners are not closed when called inside the functions, we know this isn't the correct way to deal with it, but it is an effective way to solve the problem..
 Yuyao Zhu: I wish I had more diverse options for the farming mode, instead of just taking care of trees, there can be more things to do, like raising animals, mining, etc.

 - If you had **unlimited time**, what additional features would you implement?
 Zhiwen Ji: I think I may add more rooms to different floors and would add more places to the map with different gaming functions (I didn't add too many rooms on one floor in order to not mess myself up..). Also, I think I may use the mutable graph to store the rooms on the floor/ the floors in the main house.
 Yuyao Zhu: I would add more methods player could use to customize their own farm. 

 - What was the most helpful **piece of feedback** you received while working on your project? Who gave it to you?
 Zhiwen Ji: Try to make the game not sensitive to the spelling, and make the player can access the inventory by Prof. Jordan.
Yuyao Zhu: connect the farming mode back to the adventure mode, make it more playful. 
 - If you could go back in time and give your past self some **advice** about this project, what hints would you give?
 Think more creatively (for the design about different houses).
 Yuyao Zhu: find time to attend more office hour. 

 - _If you worked with a team:_ please comment on how your **team dynamics** influenced your experience working on this project.
 Zhiwen Ji: We divided the project up to two modes and each person is responsible for their own proposed mode in the game. It is great to see how it piles up and combined into one game in the end!
 Yuyao Zhu: we divide the coding parts into adventure mode and farming mode, and we each pick a mode to code.
