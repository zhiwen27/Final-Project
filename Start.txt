This is a place of nowhere.
One day, you woke up and found yourself lying on a comfortable huge bed. Sunlight shines through the curtain, everything seems so peaceful and satisfactory.
You sat up, but suddenly realize you barely remember anything about your past:
who you are, where you are from, and what you are doing here...
You're lost in thought, but a knock on the door pulls you back into reality.
