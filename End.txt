You have finally discovered all the KEYs.
Putting all those keys together, the whole story gradually emerged in your mind:
(*See if you've already guessed the answer!)
Right, youself is not only you, but also the dragon, the village, the cause of everything.
For years, the pain of growth has been swallowing you like a knotted web, tearing apart your connection with the outside world. 
Finally, when you woke up on that one morning, the numb pain clears all your memory about the past.
And on that day, you made that decision to find out who you really are. You picked up the sword and overcame the difficulties one by
one along the way, and reached here â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€” the way out.
Along the way, you've collected the courage to face the disconnectivity between ideal and reality. You are prepared to be an adult.

And, sincerely, our final congratulations:
YOU are the WINNER!ðŸ¥³
