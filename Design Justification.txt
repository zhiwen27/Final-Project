I have considered to use mutable graph to store the rooms on the floors and floors in the Main House, so that the player can move
through the edges to visit different nodes, but I cannot get the index of nodes from guava, so I finally switched back to array list
for convenience.
I have also considered to make the Corner House more interactive, for example, having different inserted games, where players need to
answer the questions correctly to get the keys/ or make some Corner House have the same structure as the Main House for the player to
explore.
