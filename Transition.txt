You feel excited and exhausted due to the adventure. However, there is still one doubt hovering inside your mind:
What are the keys for?
And...
WHY AM I HERE?
This feeling of unease makes you want to step out of the house trapped you long and explore the world outside. But this is destined
to be a journey full of challenges and danger...

Old man: Hello my friend, long time no see! I'm glad you take the courage and want to explore WHO YOU ARE.
But first things first, let me tell you a story: The Beginning of the very Beginning
A long long time ago, people living in this valley still had connections with the outer world, however, thick layers of mist started
to gather around, blocking people's wills to keep in touch with the outside. Mumbles arise saying that a DRAGON was sleeping inside
the barren old house around the Corner, from which its breath builds up the separation.

Alright, my friend, enough for the story! I have to remind you that the journey ahead is risky. Be prepared!
