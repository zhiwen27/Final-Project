Documentation for all commands available in the game: THE NEW WORLD

// Note:  It's a good idea to also make this list available inside the game, in response to a `HELP` command.

*IMPORTANT: Please follow the commands in the parenthesis.
(However, we would not make this list available inside the game due to those instructions..)

*The game may support going "back" to previous rooms or floors, but it would only print out that the room/ floor has nothing left over to be discovered.

*You can enter "inventory" to check your inventory when exploring the Main House, however, you may not do that after you leave the Main House and continue the game in Corner House. However, there's an interaction before you leave the Main House asking if you want to check your inventory (Consider this last chance of seeing what you have discovered along the way!).

(*Also, there might be some bugs not known for the creators show up while you are playing the game, we apologize for the inconvenience.)

# SPOILER ALERT
Challenges that must be overcome to win:
*You must discover all the items in one room to keep on moving.
*You must enter the correct guess in the Corner House to win the game. Otherwise, you would lose the game, but it will ask you if you would like to try another round: if so, the game would restart from the very beginning.
