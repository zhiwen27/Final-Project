This file will contain documentation for all commands available in your game.

Note:  It's a good idea to also make this list available inside the game, in response to a `HELP` command.

*IMPORTANT: Please follow the commands in the parenthesis.
(However, we would not make this list available inside the game due to those instructions..)

(*Also, there might be some bugs not known for the creators show up while you are playing the game, we apologize for the inconvenience.)

# SPOILER ALERT

If your game includes challenges that must be overcome to win, also list them below.
