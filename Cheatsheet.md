Documentation for all commands available in the game: THE NEW WORLD
*IMPORTANT: Please follow the commands in the parenthesis.
(However, we would not make this list available inside the game due to the instructions.)

Adventure Mode:
*The game may support going "back" to previous rooms or floors, but it would only print out that the room/ floor has nothing left over to be discovered.
*You can enter "inventory" to check your inventory when exploring the Main House, however, you may not do that after you leave the Main House and continue the game in Corner House. However, there's an interaction before you leave the Main House asking if you want to check your inventory (Consider this last chance of seeing what you have discovered along the way!).

Farming Mode:
*You can enter 'options' anytime you need help.
*You can only check inventory at certain times.

*WARNING: Sometimes for both modes, if you don't enter the correct word, it will take you back to the beginning of the game.
(*There might be some bugs not known to the creators show up while you are playing the game, we apologize for the inconvenience.)

*SPOILER ALERT (challenges that must be overcome to win):
*You must discover all the items in one room to keep on moving in the Adventure Mode.
*You must enter the correct guess in the Corner House to win the game. Otherwise, you would lose the game, but it will ask you if you would like to try another round: if so, the game would restart from the very beginning in the Adventure Mode.
*You must earn enough money to win the game in the Farming Mode.
